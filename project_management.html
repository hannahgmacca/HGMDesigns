     <h2>Project Management</h2>
       <p>Through the abundance of assessments that i have done during my first semester at university, i have developed sufficient project management abilities.</p> 
       <p>The skills have been learnt through multiple ways, such as YouTube, websites, universty resources and my own experiences. I have developed time management systems that allow me to effectively manage when and how i approach my most time consuming tasks. </p>
     <h3>Time Management Examples</h3>
      <p>To ensure that i stay on top of weekly learning content and activities, i have developed time maangement excel sheets that allow me to visually see when i last reviewed a topic. This creates time efficiencies as being a student can be difficult when trying to juggle time due to the abundance in tasks that need to be completed. Below is an example of one of my excels in current use: </p>
