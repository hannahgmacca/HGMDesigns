   <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
   <p>
    Welcome to Hannah's portfolio! I have developed this website portfolio as part of Southern Cross Universities Website Development unit, and will use it to showcase the myriad of HTML and CSS development skills learnt over semester 1. Please feel free to use the navigation bar to explore the website and find out more.

    <h2>ASPIRATIONS</h2>   
    <p>
     I aim to finish my studies with the skills and knowledge to be a qualified and 
     resourceful IT specialist, with a possibility of starting my own small business in 
     website development as i have always loved the idea of building my own small company
     and being my own boss. Other important abilities i wish to take away from my degree 
     are communicational, management and organisational skills, which prove to be important 
     in any career.
