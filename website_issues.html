     <h2>WEBSITE ISSUES</h2>
       <p>
       Throughout the design process of creating this process, there has been careful consideration in making design decisions in regards to website issues. Below is three of my most important design changes:
       <br></p>
     <h3>GLOBAL UNITY</h3>      
       <p>The previous versions of this website were quite monochromatic, with limited thought put into colour theme and overall aesthetic. There was no consideration of how the design of the website could impact others. According to STEM UK (2017) “a careful choice of name,
       shape and colour can help promote a sense of unity between different global cultures”. This knowledge resonated with  me, and I then chose to develop a website with a more global design and chose a website name of ‘Hagram’ which is a  shortening of my full name, Hannah Grace McDonald. This name change from ‘Hannah’s Portfolio’ was chosen as it is a more universal title, it isn’t a word from English and thus will provide more impact on anyone visiting my website, regardless of their nationality. </p>
     <h3>COPYRIGHT</h3>
       <p>In the prototyping and testing of my website, I was initially choosing to use an image taken from another part of the web. This image was not copyright free, but I was going to crop it and change it to become more of my own image. It was then realised that although the image would be changed, it was still unethical and even illegal to use any part of the image without getting direct permission from the owner of the image (Hawkins, 2011). I then made the decision to use an image from a copyright-free image provider website called Unsplash.com. </p>
     <h3>SECURITY</h3>
       <p>The development of my website initially had no thought of security requirements in mind, and I began creating a website overflowing with elements and add-ons. According to Cloud Bric (2017) “These days, simplicity is the golden rule, and minimizing add-ons and plug-ins is recommended for aesthetic, operational, and security concerns. The main thrust of your site should be text-based and presenting your product clearly, with images and design flourishes playing in the backup band”. This information led to many formal design changes in my website, as I then developed a simple, but effective aesthetic which was mainly text-based, but used graphics as a ‘design flourish playing in the backup band’, and therefore increasing the security and usability of my website.</p>

   <h2>WEBSITE HOSTING</h2> 
     <h3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h3>
       <p>This report aims to research the options available when choosing a web host provider. Through this research, it is found that out of the three providers of Dreamhost, Bluehost and GoDaddy that Dreamhost offers the most bandwidth, software, reliability and storage and thus, is the most suitable option for the hosting of HAGRAM Design’s portfolio site. </p>  
     <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
       <p>According to Felke-Morris (2016, pp. 446), &lsquo;a number of factors need to be considered when choosing a webhost provider, these include bandwidth, disk storage support and the availability of e-commerce packages&rsquo;. This report will be evaluating three virtual web host providers that are Dreamhost, Bluehost and GoDaddy. By comparing each hosts cost, software, storage space and reliability, the most value for money and suitable host will be found.</p>
     <h3>EXPLANATION</h3>
       <p>Below is a summary of each hosts costs and features:</p>
   
   <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Host</th>
        <th>Monthly Cost AUD</th>
        <th>Bandwidth</th>
        <th>Software Offered</th>
        <th>Reliability</th>
        <th>Storage</th>  
      </tr> 
      <tr>
        <td>Dreamhost</td>
        <td>Shared basic plan $5.99</td>
        <td>Unmetered</td>
        <td>PHP, MySQL, SVN, SSI, IPv6, Rails, Python, Perl </td>
        <td>100% uptime</td>
        <td>Unlimited SSD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bluehost</td>
        <td>Shared basic plan $5.60</td>
        <td>Unmetered</td>
        <td>PHP, MySQL, Rails, Python </td>
        <td>99.9% uptime</td>
        <td>50GB SSD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GoDaddy</td>
        <td>Shared basic plan $4.99</td>
        <td>Unmetered</td>
        <td>PHP, MySQL</td>
        <td>99.97% uptime</td>
        <td>100GB SSD</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
     <p>Because of the information found above, the host chosen will be Dreamhost. Although they are the most expensive per month, they offer the most software, bandwidth, reliability and software features which Bluehost and GoDaddy do not. It is seen through research of their websites, that the former two hosts are the cheapest because they charge a lot more to add-on the features that Dreamhost already provides. </p>
   <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
     <p>Researching web host providers and their plans is important, as the initial plan price may not reflect how cost effective the plan really is. Through comparing three major host providers that are Dreamhost, Bluehost and GoDaddy, it is found that Dreamhost offers the most out of their services for only 39c more per month than the next cheapest.</p>
