     <h2>COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h2>
       <p>Beginning my working life at a fast-faced team based environment such as McDonald's has given me a strong founation to be able to communicate effectively in both my work and personal life. These skills have also been tested since commencing university studies, as communication skills both written and spoken have come to be very important.</p>
       <p>For one of my units, i conducted a research report into communication issues found within organisations. I believe this project is a good reflection of my interpersonal skills as i had to not only use my own communicative skills to conduct the report, but had to have a strong grasp on the theories and practice of professional communications. </p>
